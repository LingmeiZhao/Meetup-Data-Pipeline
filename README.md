# Meetup-Data-Pipeline

## Introduction
I built a data pipeline that can be used to process Meetup in real-time. This data pipeline can automatically get data about Meetup reviews in real-time from Meetup Streaming API. I wrote scripts for Python and Bash, fetched the data and preprocessed the data, and uploaded the data to a MySQL database. On the other hand, I used Hive to analyze the obtained data and calculate some indicators I needed. Finally, I developed a Dashboard using R Shiny to display the calculated indicators.
